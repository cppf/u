DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION — EDIT THIS FILE BEFORE DEPLOYING
=====================================================================

This is the ONLY file you need to touch before deploying. Every other
file in this repository is ready to go as-is.

Fill in BOT_TOKEN below with a real token from @BotFather on Telegram
(search for "BotFather", send it /newbot, follow the prompts, and it
will give you a token that looks like
"123456789:AAExampleTokenTextGoesHere").

RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN and PORT are normally provided automatically by
Railway at deploy time — you only need to fill those in here if you are
running this bot somewhere other than Railway (see the comments below).

HOW THIS FILE IS USED: core.config.load_config() checks environment
variables FIRST (BOT_TOKEN, PORT, RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN) and only falls
back to the constants below if the matching environment variable is
unset or empty. On Railway, set BOT_TOKEN as an environment variable in
the service settings instead of editing this file, if you'd rather not
commit your token to source control — both approaches work; this file
exists for people who want a true single-file, no-environment-
variables-to-configure deployment.

SECURITY NOTE: if you fill in a real token below and commit this file to
a public repository, your bot token will be public. Anyone with your bot
token can control your bot. Prefer the Railway environment variable
(BOT_TOKEN) over editing this file if your repository is or might become
public. Never commit a real token to a public repo.

# Your bot token from @BotFather. Replace the placeholder below.
#
# Example of what a real token looks like (this is not a real token):
# "123456789:AAHk3fL9dQZ7xY2wRt8pV1sN4mK6jC0bXeE"
BOT_TOKEN = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_FROM_BOTFATHER"

# The port the webhook HTTP server listens on. Railway provides this
# automatically via the PORT environment variable — you normally do not
# need to change this constant. It's only used as a fallback if PORT is
# not set in the environment (e.g. running outside Railway without
# setting it yourself).
PORT = 8080

# The public domain Telegram will send webhook updates to (no scheme,
# e.g. "my-bot.up.railway.app", not "https://my-bot.up.railway.app").
# Railway provides this automatically via the RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN
# environment variable — leave this as the placeholder if deploying on
# Railway. Only fill this in if deploying elsewhere (a VPS, another
# PaaS, etc.) without that environment variable set.
RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN = "REPLACE_IF_NOT_USING_RAILWAY"
